# Marks-Assessment

This project is an amalgamation of database systems and  programming so methods of incorporating them together was our first plan of action. Using a mind-map I first broke down the project to its various components, mentioning all of its parameters and attributes. I then found ways in which every aspect can be made user friendly from data collection to date presentation. Most of the planning went into assuring that both the code and backend data were in sync with one another.

I mainly used commands from TCL, DML and DCL under SQL. In code, I have started off by prompting the user to choose among the multiple options given to manipulate the students’ marks information. On choosing one of the criterions, they are taken to the function that handles that particular option. There are many sub-parts to each option, thus giving the user a variety of alternatives to work with. It allows the user to store, access, delete and manipulate students’ mark’s data, to retrieve the highest scorer in each subject, and the ranks according to a particular viva teacher
