# Marks-Assessment

This project is an amalgam of database systems and  programming so methods of incorporating them together 
was our first plan of action. 
Using a mind-map we first broke down the project to its 
various components, mentioning all of its parameters and 
attributes. We then found ways in which every aspect can 
be made user friendly from data collection to date 
presentation. 
Most of our planning went into assuring that both the 
frontend and backend were in sync with one another.
